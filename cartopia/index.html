                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is made for the course Augmented Reality and Mobile App Development. In this course we learned to create
                    mobile apps using Flutter and at the end of the course we learned how to implement Wikitude for Augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this group project is making a augmented reality app that makes use of a least 1 of the 4 flavours of augmented reality and a api.
                    My group decided to take a car theme, you get a card with a car model, if you scan this card with the app you unlock the car in your collection but you can also see a 3D model
                    on your screen on top of the car.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/carModel.jpg" alt="Picture of a car model">
                    <figcaption>Example of a model on a car</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <h2>My contributions</h2>
            <div id="models">

                <h3>Preparing the models</h3>
                <p>
                    The app uses 12 car models. We didnt make these model ourselve but looked for free to use models online. 
                    The issue was that these models all had diffrent sizes and were in the wrong filetype. So i had to manually convert 
                    the models to the right extention type followed by using the Wikitude 3D encoder to make Wikitude read the model. 
                    The next step is implementing the converted models into the config file and rescaling them,
                    putting them in the right location and rotate the models so they all are in the perfect spot.
                    The config of wikitude is written in Javascript.
                </p>

                        <figcaption>Example of a model</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                <h3>JSON-server</h3>
                <p>
                    For simplicity in this project and because the main focus
                    is the app with the augmented reality we just used a simple JSON-server with a local tunnel.
                    I filled the JSON database with the data we needed. 
                </p>

                <div>
                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>
                    Ofcourse I did some coding of the flutter app aswell. For example the part of the collected cards. Not all the cards
                    are hard coded. This is with the help from a loop that looks how much cards there are in the database. Then the code looks if
                    you already scanned the card. If you scanned the card it shows the card, otherwise it shows a card that isn't discovered yet.
                </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div>
                Augmented reality is a really fun technologie to use in apps. In this project I learned a lot about
                augmented reality and flutter. Flutter has a lot of diffrent things you can use. If you can think of it,
                Flutter probably has it in their library. In this project we also used github for version control and it helped us fixing
                some parts of the code that worked before. Everytime you work with Github in a group pay attention when you push or pull code!
