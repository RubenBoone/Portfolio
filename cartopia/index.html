                    <p>
                        This project is made for the course Augmented Reality and Mobile App Development. 
                        In this course unit, we learned to create mobile apps using Flutter and at the 
                        end of the course we learned how to implement Wikitude for Augmented reality.                    </p>

                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this group project is making an augmented reality 
                        app that makes use of at least 1 of the 4 flavors of augmented 
                        reality and an API. My group decided to take a car theme, 
                        you get a card with a car model, if you scan this card with 
                        the app you unlock the car in your collection, but you can also 
                        see a 3D model on your screen on top of the car.

                    <h3>Preparing the models</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app uses 12 car models. We didn't make these model ourselves, but looked for free to use models online. 
                        The issue was that these models all had different sizes and were in the wrong file type. So I had to manually convert 
                        the models to the right extension type, followed by using the Wikitude 3D encoder to make Wikitude read the model. 
                        The next step is implementing the converted models into the config file and rescaling them,
                        putting them in the right location and rotate the models, so they all are in the perfect spot.
                        The config of Wikitude is written in JavaScript.

                <h3>JSON-server</h3>
                <p>
                    For simplicity in this project and because the main focus
                    is the app with the augmented reality, we just used a simple JSON-server with a local tunnel.
                    I filled the JSON database with the data we needed so we could easily start a JSON server with a CLI and then
                    use a local tunnel so we could access the database easily over the internet.                </p>
                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>
                    Ofcourse I did some coding of the flutter app as well. For example, the part of the collected cards. Not all the cards
                    are hard coded. This is with the help from a loop that looks at how many cards there are in the database. Then the code looks if
                    you already scanned the card. If you scanned the card it shows the card, otherwise it shows a card that isn't discovered yet.
                    The page with the camera is also something I created. Nothing special but my part of the project was mainly implementing the augmented
                    reality into the project.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div>
                Augmented reality is a really fun technologies to use in apps. In this project I learned a lot about
                augmented reality and flutter. Flutter has a lot of different things you can use. If you can think of it,
                Flutter probably has it in their library. In the project, we also used GitHub to merge our code together without too much hassle. 
                Every time you work with GitHub in a group, pay attention when you push or pull code!
